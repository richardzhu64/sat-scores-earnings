# Average SAT Scores versus Student Earnings
This is source code for a visualization of relationship between average SAT scores and student earnings across US colleges created using R. This visualization was created using data taken from Opportunity Insights.

The overall shape of the relationship seems to be an inverted S-shape, implying an inflection point at which higher average SAT scores are more associated with higher incomes. Moreover, the graph shows a dichotomy between public and private universities by SAT score - public universities are more clustered towards lower average SAT scores while colleges with high average SAT scores are predominantly private.
